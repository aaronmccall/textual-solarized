Textual-Solarized is a Textual IRC style for OSX. You can find Textual at http://www.codeux.com/textual/ or on the App Store.

I have derived this from @excid3's Solarized theme for Textual and made some tweaks based on personal preference w/r/t the Solarized color scheme (http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized).


Installation
============
Checkout this git repo into ~/Library/Application Support/Textual/Styles in a sub-folder and it will be an available option in the Textual preferences pane.

    cd ~/Library/Containers/com.codeux.irc.textual/Data/Library/Application\ Support/Textual\ IRC/Styles/
    git clone https://github.com/ezanol/textual-solarized.git
